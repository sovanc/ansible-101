Roles and Galaxy
===

While it is possible to write a playbook in one very large file (and you might start out learning playbooks this way), eventually youâ€™ll want to reuse files and start to organize things.

Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

The anatomy of a role.

```
- hosts: webservers
  vars_files:
    - vars/main.yml
  roles:
    - { role: geerlingguy.apache }
```


```
$ ansible-galaxy
```
