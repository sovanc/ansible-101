Practical Ansible
---

* There is probably a role for that.
* You can probably fork and implement your own change in that role easier than you can write your own role.
* There is probably a module for that.
* No seriously there is probably a module for THAT.
* Read the module docs.
* Don't recreate bash scripts.
* Command and shell are last resorts.
* Don't even think about executing a script. Why are you even here?
* Defaults are nice cause they let other people override them. Be kind to people who reuse your roles.
* Variables are hard to override so use them when you want to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot.
* Variables can be put in a lot of places. Make a decisions and keep it logically consistent.
* Dynamic inventories are magic but start out with a static one until you get the hang of it. 
* Write the role to solve your problem first then refactor it to make it usable by the open source community.
* If you have a lot of conditionals (when this do this), remember that tags exists.
* Modular code is reusable code.
* Playbooks should not be monolithic.
* Ansible can run adhoc commands in a bind.
* Protect your secrets with ansible-vault of credstash!
