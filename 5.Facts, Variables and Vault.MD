Facts, Variables and Vault
===

Facts are just like english. They are a fact about a host or a fact about a play during a specific scope of the playbook. You can use a debug statement(module) to give print out the variable in a specific scope.

http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/debug_module.html

```
- name: Display all variables/facts known for a host
  debug:
    var: hostvars[inventory_hostname]
    verbosity: 4
```

Variables can be set at many levels but we will go over the most common places.

Let's look at the anatomy of a ansible playbook and the assumptions it makes. Here is a typical structure.

* defaults
* files
* handlers
* meta
* tasks
* templates
* vars

Each of these folders have convention of configuration purpose. As you investigate more into ansible, you will get more comfortable with each of these folders but let's start with the basics.

Each of these folders, if it exists, will be picked up by an ansible play (AUTOMATICALLY), IF there is a file named main.yml inside that folder. What does that look like now?

* defaults
 * main.yml
* files
 * NOT SO FAST
* handlers
 * main.yml
* meta
 * main.yml
* tasks
 * main.yml
* templates
 * NOT SO FAST
* vars
 * main.yml

The files and templates directories are the exception. The templates/files directories are default search locations. When the file or template module are used, the playbook will look for files and templates inside those directories.

We have lost focus. We were talking about variables and facts. Let's discover the subtle difference between a fact and a variable.

"Information discovered from systems: Facts"

Facts are variables that are set by the system, and explicit facts we set with the set_fact module. You can turn off fact gathering by seting gather_facts to False in the playbook.


* So, a system's host can set facts about a machine.
* You can also set system facts about a machine with a built in module.
* You can put vars in the vars/main.yml file. 
* You can also put vars in the defaults/main.yml
* You can also put vars, as we have seen all along, inline in the command.
* You can place vars in the inventory file.
* Ansible also has a structure to play local vars inside of an include play.

Which variable wins?
* role defaults
* inventory vars 
* inventory group_vars
* inventory host_vars
* playbook group_vars
* playbook host_vars
* host facts
* play vars
* play vars_prompt
* play vars_files
* registered vars
* set_facts
* role and include vars
* block vars (only for tasks in block)
* task vars (only for the task)
* extra vars (always win precedence)


Playbooks with Variables
---

```
---
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  tasks:
  - name: ping the server
    ping:

- hosts: webserver
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: install httpd
    yum: name=httpd state={{ httpd_state }}
```

Exercises
---
* Take a look at play1v3.yml run that command against our ec2 instances. Solve any problems.
* Can you recreate an inventory that sets the var1 variable for all the machines with 1 line instead of 3?
* Variables are powerful and useful. Facts are also useful. What are your guesses on the best places to put variables? (trick question)
