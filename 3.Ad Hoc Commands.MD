Ad Hoc Commands
===
Now we have 3 servers and we can ssh into those machines. We can also use our dynamic or static inventory to run ansible commands against those machines. We have learned that an ansible playbook is a set of plays. We dove deeper into that concept. Let's take a step back and look at an even more fundamental unit of ansible that we will relate back to our playbooks. Ad Hoc Commands. Ad hoc commands are one off commands run against a group of servers. They are executed via the ansible CLI. 

```
$ ansible
```

Notable Options for Ad Hoc Commands
---

Usage: ansible <host-pattern> [options]

* -a MODULE_ARGS
* -e EXTRA_VARS
* -i INVENTORY
* -m MODULE_NAME
* -f FORKS

There are a couple of key questions we need to ask. What is a module? Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are the ones that do the actual work in ansible, they are what gets executed in each playbook task. But you can also run a single one using the ‘ansible’ command.

First adhoc commands

see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ping_module.html

```
$ ansible all -m ping -i inventory_aws
```

```
$ ansible webserver -m command -a "whoami" -i inventory_aws2
```

```
$ ansible all -m ping -f 1 inventory_aws2
$ ansible all -m ping -f 2 inventory_aws2
$ ansible all -m ping -f 3 inventory_aws2
```


Exercises
===
* Run an ad hoc command against every server to ping them. Note the output.
* Run a yum update on the server. It might be tricky.
* Create an adhoc command to install a service.
* Restart that service in that server. Try to restart a service on a machine that does not have a service installed.
* Why are inventories optional?
* What are the limitations of ad hoc commands?
* Run ad hoc commands with different numbers of forks and notice the speed. Time the difference.
