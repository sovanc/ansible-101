Getting started with EC2
===

We are going to go over an advanced playbook that does not run on ANY host machines but does run on the control machine. This type of playbook is not ansible 101 but we are going to jump in the deep end to create our hosts needed for the rest of the tutorial. This will allow us to envision where ansible can go as we continue the tutorial. Do not worry if all of this playbook doesn't make sense but remember the power of what we get at the end and get excited!

Quick Side Note
---
As an important aside, these plays will require AWS keys set as environment varialbes to allow our control machine to connect to the AWS API.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKI'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='zd3'
```

SSH key setup
---
Create an ssh key in the AWS console. Login to the AWS management console and find the EC2 service. In the side bar, find the "Network & Security" tab and open up "Key Pairs". Click "Create Key Pair" and give the key the name "ansible_key". The site will prompt a download of a pem file. Move that pem file into a place you are comfortable with and change the permissions to 400.

```
chmod 400 ansible_key.pem
```

Inventory File
---

An inventory is simple file that lists groups and hosts with the needed information to ssh into those hosts effectively.


Inventory Example 1
```
204.236.213.231
54.146.252.114
54.175.250.172
```

Inventory Example 2
```
[aws_instances]
204.236.213.231
54.146.252.114
54.175.250.172
```

Inventory Example 3
```
[webservers]
204.236.213.231
54.146.252.114

[dbservers]
54.175.250.172

[aws_instances:children]
webservers
dbservers
```

Inventory Example 4 - Dynamic Inventory
Setup your own dymamic inventory script. Here is the reading to do this exact thing.
