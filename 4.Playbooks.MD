We have forks still. We have extra vars still. We have an inventory still. We also have tags which are new. We also have to specify a playbook. 


Playbooks and plays are the core of ansible and what we will be learning today. We have arrived. Congratulations! Let's look at the model again and create a sentence that will tell us what our ansible-playbook command is doing.

Can you come up with a sentence?

Our First playbook
---

Let's look at the anatomy of a basic playbook now.

```
---
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ec2-user
  tasks:
  - name: ping the server
    ping:
  - name: print the datetime
    command: "date"

- hosts: webserver
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: install httpd
    yum: name=httpd
```

Exercises
===
* What happens when you remove, become or remote_user?
* Is the httpd service running?
* Use the service module and add a task to start httpd.
* Why can we still not reach the website?
* What playbook controls the security groups allowed through our AWS firewall?
* Can you fix that?
* How many ad hoc commands would it take to recreate a playbook like the one above?
